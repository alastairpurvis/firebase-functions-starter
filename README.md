# Bootstrap a Firebase ES7

This boilerplate helps to start with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [modern JavaScript Features](http://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env/).

This boilerplate is largely inspired by [jthegedus](https://github.com/jthegedus) [repository](https://github.com/jthegedus/blog-code).

## Set your Firebase project

Update .firebaserc to set your project.
```
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "your-project"
  }
}
```

## Start local server
```
npm run serve
```

## Start local shell
```
npm run shell
```
